# Learned Follower NN

## Overview
Learned Follower NN is a comprehensive research project designed by Adam Jackson to develop and test neural networks (NNs) that learn from experimental data to perform in simulated environments. This project encompasses data processing, neural network training, and simulations to evaluate the performance of the trained models.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into several key directories:
- data/
  - raw/: Contains raw experimental data.
  - processed/: Contains data processed and formatted for neural network training.
- scripts/
  - data_preparation/: Scripts to convert raw data into training-ready formats.
  - training/: Scripts for training neural networks.
- models/
  - trained/: Stores trained neural network models.
  - simulation/: Scripts and models for testing the NN in a simulation environment.
- notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for data visualization and exploratory analysis.

## Setup
To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:
1. Clone the Repository:
   git clone https://github.com/yourGithubUsername/learned_follower_nn.git
   cd learned_follower_nn
2. Install Required Libraries:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
To use the scripts and run simulations:
1. Prepare the Data:
   python scripts/data_preparation/prepare_data.py
2. Train the Neural Network:
   python scripts/training/train_model.py
3. Run Simulations:
   python models/simulation/run_simulation.py
